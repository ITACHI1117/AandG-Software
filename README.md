# A&G Update Software README

## Overview

The A&G Update software is a tool designed to streamline the process of pushing policies to NIIID (National Insurance and Investment Information Database). It offers both manual and automatic policy pushing capabilities. This README will guide you on how to use the software effectively.

## Manual Policy Push

1. **Select Date Range:**
   - Open the A&G Update software.
   - Choose the "Manual Push" option.
   - Select the desired start and end dates using the date picker.

2. **Initiate Push:**
   - Click the "Push" button.
   - The program will open a Chrome window and automate the navigation process.
   - IMPORTANT: Do not interact with the browser during this process, as it may cause errors.

3. **View Push Messages:**
   - After the program completes the push, a new window will open displaying the push messages.

## Automatic Policy Push

1. **Start Automatic Push:**
   - Click the "Push Automatically" button.
   - The program will automatically set the date range from January 1st of the current year to May 1st of the current year.

2. **Automated Process:**
   - Similar to the manual push, a Chrome window will open with an automated navigation process.
   - Again, avoid any interaction with the browser while the process is running.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - In case of an error during the automatic push, the "Continue Push?" button will become enabled.
   - This allows you to continue the push from where the error occurred.

## Log Files

- The software stores logs for each policy push in the "LOG" folder.
- Some log files might not contain push details if there was an error during the push that the software did not return.
- You can manually push the specific file and retrieve the details in such cases.
